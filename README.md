## ⚙️ **What I Learned**

In building this app, I learned:

- How to create a **functional component** in React.
- The **useState** hook for managing component state.
- The **useEffect** hook for setting up side effects such as updating the clock every second.
- How to format **dates and times** using JavaScript (`getHours`, `getMinutes`, `getSeconds`).
- How to **manage intervals** using `setInterval` and clean them up with `clearInterval` inside `useEffect`.
- **CSS styling** for creating a simple and clean UI.
